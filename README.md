# Comparing-Sequential-Models-GRU-LSTM-Simple-RNN-for-Name-Country-Prediction
In this project, using a dataset of names of people in different countries, we intend to predict which country a name belongs to. This project has been modeled separately with three different sequential models, including Simple RNN, LSTM, and GRU, and the results of the modeling have been compared with each other.
